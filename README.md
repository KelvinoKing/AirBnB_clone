<h2>Project Objectives<h2/>

After 4 months, it will have a complete web application composed by:

	-A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface,
	 like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

	-A website (the front-end) that shows the final product
	 to everybody: static and dynamic

	-A database or files that store data (data = objects)

	-An API that provides a communication interface between
	 the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
