# AirBnB_Clone

**This project is an AirBnB clone. You can check out AirBnB website
by following this link https://www.airbnb.com/**

## Project Objectives

**After 4 months, it will have a complete web application composed by:**

	- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface,
	  like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

	- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product
	  to everybody: static and dynamic

	- A database or files that store data (data = objects)

	- An API that provides a communication interface between
	  the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Concepts Learned
